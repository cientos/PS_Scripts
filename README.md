Small Scripts for Photoshop

Hello!
This is a repository that I created mainly for my personal use. I am not a developer, nor a programmer, I just like making some tools to speed up my workflow in Photoshop. Therefore, the scripts you will find here are very simple, and focused to provide a solution to a key feature that I find is tedious to do by hand in Photoshop. 

All being said, feel free to download and try them. I did them to help me, so if they work for you too, all the better!
They work as intended for the most part, but if you encounter a bug or have a suggestion for me, feel free to contact me! :)
